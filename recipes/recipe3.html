                    <h3>How to make Homemade Vada Pav Recipe With Cheesy Aloo Vada</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To begin making the Homemade Vada Pav Recipe With Cheesy Aloo Vada we will first make the dry garlic chutney powder.</li>
                        <li>Into a preheated pan add oil, sesame seeds, dry red chillies, and allow the sesame seeds to crackle.</li>
                        <li>Once done add the garlic cloves and roast them until the raw smell of the garlic goes away.</li>
                        <li>Once done add the desiccated coconut, salt to taste. Roast until lightly golden in colour and turn off the heat. Allow the garlic mixture to cool.</li>
                        <li>Once the mixture has cooled completely add it to the blender and blend to make a coarse powder. Keep aside.</li>
                        <li>The next step is to make the Vada for the Vada Pav.</li>
                        <li>Into a preheated pan add oil. Once the oil is hot add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle.</li>
                        <li>Once the mustard seeds have crackled add the onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, asafoetida and saute until the onions soften and turn golden brown in colour.</li>
                        <li>After the onions have changed colour add the boiled potatoes, turmeric powder and salt to taste. Mix well to combine and saute for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Finally add the chopped coriander leaves, stir to combine and turn off the heat.</li>
                        <li>Allow the potato mixture to cool down before making the vadas.</li>
                        <li>While the potato mixture is cooling make the vada batter. Into a mixing bowl add gram flour, turmeric powder, ajwain, salt to taste and add little water at a time to make a thick lump free batter which coats the back of the spoon. Keep aside.</li>
                        <li>Now grease your palms with oil. Take a large lemon size portion of the potato mixture. Flatten it and place a few chopped cheese cubes in the centre. Bring the edges of the potato mixture together and seal. Make a small disc and keep aside.</li>
                        <li>Shape and make similar cheese filled potato discs and keep them ready.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a heavy bottom pan on medium heat; dip and coat each of the vada balls in the gram flour batter and gradually let it into the oil and deep fry until golden brown in color.</li>
                        <li>Take care not to turn the heat to high as this will not evenly cook the batter and you might just end up with over browned and uncooked portions. Drain the fried Aloo Vadas on an oil absorbent paper and continue the frying process for the remaining vadas.</li>
                        <li>To Toast the pav buns smear butter over the buns and place them on a preheated pan. Toast until slightly golden and crisp.</li>
                        <li>To serve the Vada Pav With Cheesy Aloo Vada smear garlic chutney over one slice of the toasted pav bun. Place the Vada between the pav to make a sandwich and serve hot.</li>
                        <li>Serve Homemade Vada Pav Recipe With Cheesy Aloo Vada as a tea time snack along with Date and Tamarind Chutney, Green Chutney and Adrak Chai.</li>
