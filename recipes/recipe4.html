                        <ol>
                            <li>We begin making the Delhi Style Matar Chaat Recipe by soaking the dried green peas / matar for at least 5 to 6 hours or overnight and keep it aside.</li>
                            <li>Heat a pressure cooker with oil, add bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and fennel seeds. Saute till the aroma comes out.</li>
                            <li>Add ginger and saut√© for a few seconds. Add tomatoes and cook until softened.</li>
                            <li>Finally, add the rest of the spice powders and give the masala for the chaat a stir. Cook until the raw smell goes away, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Add the soaked dried green peas and stir. Add 2 cups of water and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles or for at least 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the heat.</li>
                            <li>Once done, release the pressure naturally, as the Matar Chaat will continue to cook while there is pressure.</li>
                            <li>Check the taste, add lemon juice and stir. Transfer the Delhi Style Matar Chaat Recipe to small serving bowls.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle onions, ginger, green chilies, drizzle the mint chutney, and top it up with chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot.</li>
                            <li>Serve the Delhi Style Matar Chaat Recipe as it is or along with Baked Amritsari Kulcha or Puri with a glass of Rose Lassi Recipe to enjoy your lunch meal.</li>
