Delicate cottage cheese dumplings, soaked in sugar syrup, theyâ€™re also called Rosogolla. The process has multiple steps, but yields a super soft rasgulla that is steamed and then soaked in a flavoured sugar syrup.

                    I typically like to flavor the sugar syrup with a rose petals for a refreshing festive flavour, but you could also use saffron or cardamom depending on your preference. Rasgulla may be served on festivals like Navratri or Diwali, but are equally wonderful when served at the end of an Indian thali meal for friends and family.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash the paneer well to avoid lemon taste in rasgullas.</li>
                            <li>Squeeze the maximum to drain the water and then place a weight.</li>
                            <li>You can use the whey water for making chapati batter.</li>
                            <li>Kneading the dough is a very important step to get the rasgullas soft.</li>
                            <li>My friend's mother suggested to add a teaspoon of maida and stir after kneading the paneer. This helps rasgullas to be a bit firm and withstand their round shape.</li>
                            <li>If you feel the paneer is very much drained or is not binding while making balls, then drizzle some drops of water alone and knead again.</li>
                            <li>Please make sure to use a wide cooker or pan as rasgulla expand after cooking.</li>
                            <li>Do replace rasgullas to another bowl after cooking to avoid overheating.</li>
                            <li>We can also prepare them in a large pan by simply closing them for 10 to 15 minutes after paneer balls are added.</li>
                            <li>When rasgullas are cooked they are extremely soft but will get firm after refrigerating.</li>
